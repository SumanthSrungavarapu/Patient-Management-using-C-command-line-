In this project our aim is to create a patient management system for a hospital, Hospital want to create records of all patients and wants a system for easy retrieval

For simplicity we will make a system that operates through command line .

So the following information will tell us how our system works
 
 first there will be a prompt enter a unique patient id 
 if it is a new one a new record will be created
 if it is a old id the old details will show up and displys us some options to choose
 
 I am using binary files to store patient records
